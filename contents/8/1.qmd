## Hello world for R



```{r}
print('Hello world!')
```


## Essential concepts

- In R, assignments is ` <- `, not `=`. `=` actually works, but it may cause confusions. So it is always recommended to use ` <- `. The R Studio keybinding for ` <- ` is `alt+-`.
- `.` is NOT a special character in R, and can be used in variable names. So `is.na()` simply means a function called `is.na`. It is not a function `na` in a package `is` as in Python.
- In R, the block is defined by `{}`. Indentation is not that important.
- R has a better package management system than Python, and therefore in most cases you don't need virtual environment for R.


### R Markdown / Quarto
The counterpart of Jupyter notebook in R is `.rmd/.qmd` file. Similar to a notebook, in a R Markdown / Quarto file, there is a so-called code block that can run the codes inside to produce documents with both texts and codes and codes outputs.

In the following two sections about R, you are supposed to submit `.rmd/.qmd` file.

Quarto is an extension/continuation of R Markdown. Most R Markdown file can be directly translated to a Quarto file without many modifications. The main difference between R Markdown and Quarto is that Quarto has better support for other languages such as Python and Julia. You may go to [its homepage](https://quarto.org/) for more details. 

This note is produced by Quarto.
:::

The most import part of R Markdown / Quarto is the code block, that is 
```{{r}}
print('Hello world!')
```
In Quarto, you may also write

```{{python}}
print('Hello world!')
```
There are many options to adjust how the code blocks are excacuted. You don't need to worry about them right now. Currently just try to write your report together with code blocks.

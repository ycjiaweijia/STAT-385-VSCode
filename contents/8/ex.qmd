## Exercises



::: {#exr-}
Start a R Markdown / Quarto file. In the first section write a R code block to print `Hello world!`.
:::


::: {#exr-}
Which of these are character strings and which are numbers? `1`, `"1"`, `"one"`.
:::


::: {#exr-}
Create an atomic vector that stores just the face names of the cards: the ace of spades, king of spades, queen of spades, jack of spades, and ten of spades. Which type of vector will you use to save the names?

Hint: The face name of the ace of spades would be `ace` and `spades` is the suit.
:::



::: {#exr-}
Create the following matrix, which stores the name and suit of every card in a royal flush.

```{r}
#| echo: false
hand <- c("ace", "spades", "king", "spades", "queen", "spades", "jack", "spades", "ten", "spades")
matrix(hand, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE)
```

Many card games assign a numerical value to each card. For example, in blackjack, each face card is worth 10 points, each number card is worth between 2 and 10 points, and each ace is worth 1 or 11 points, depending on the final score.

Make a virtual playing card by combining “ace” “heart” and 1 into a vector. What type of atomic vector will result? Check if you are right, and explain your reason.
:::



::: {#exr-}
Use a list to store a single playing card, like the ace of hearts, which has a point value of one. The list should save the face of the card, the suit, and the point value in separate elements.
:::


::: {#exr-}
Consider the following data.frame.

```{r}
suit <- c('spades', 'hearts', 'clubs', 'diamonds')
face <- 1:5
deck <- expand.grid(suit, face)
```
Please write some codes to count how many rows whose `Var1` are equal to `hearts`.
:::


::: {#exr-}
Converte the following sentences into tests written with R code. 

- `w <- c(-1, 0, 1)`. Is `w` positive?
- `x <- c(5, 15)`. Is `x` greater than `10` and less than `20`?
- `y <- 'February'`. Is object `y` the word `February`?
- `z <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Friday")`. Is every value in `z` a day of the week?

::: {#exr-}
Please write a function to shuffle the row of a data.frame. You may use the following data.frame `deck` for test.

```{r}
suit <- c('spades', 'hearts', 'clubs', 'diamonds')
face <- 1:13
deck <- expand.grid(suit, face)
```
